## 🚀 Project Overview

**OmniScraper v14.0** represents a paradigm shift in data acquisition, moving away from brittle, regex-based scrapers toward a next-generation market intelligence dashboard. It is engineered to simulate, retrieve, and interpret real-time pricing data for global e-commerce assets with high fidelity.

Unlike traditional scrapers that often break during website updates, OmniScraper utilizes a **Dual-Core Processing Engine**. This architecture enables the system to switch dynamically between live, AI-grounded data retrieval (powered by **Google Gemini**) and a sophisticated **Static Simulation Protocol**.

## 🌟 Elite Engineering Features

### 🧠 **Dual-Core Neural Engine (Gemini 1.5 Flash)**
* **Live AI Grounding:** Integrates **Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash** API to perform semantic data extraction. Instead of looking for specific HTML tags, the engine "understands" the context of trending bestsellers.
* **Fail-Safe Protocol:** Transitions to a curated **Static Database** of 25+ genres if the AI gateway is congested, preventing system downtime.
* **Smart Error Handling:** Automatically detects `404 Model` errors or API timeouts, rerouting the logic pipeline to ensure 99.9% uptime.

### 🌐 **Global Intelligence Nodes (Multi-Region)**
* **Region-Locked Routing:** Pivot the scraping node between three major economic zones: **India (Asia-South1)**, **USA (Virginia)**, and **UK (London)**.
* **PPP Adjustment Logic:** Applies **Purchasing Power Parity** math, ensuring that local pricing estimates reflect real-world market affordability rather than raw currency conversion.

### 📊 **Advanced Analytics & Visualization**
* **Predictive Trends:** Generates high-fidelity, 7-day price forecast charts using volatility-weighted algorithms.
* **Neural Pattern Recognition:** Identifies **"Hidden Gems"** by analyzing the ratio between user ratings and price points.
* **3D Value Matrix:** Maps the relationship between price, rating, and volume in an interactive scatter plot.

 ## **⚠️ Accuracy Disclaimer**

Note: The values presented as "Avg Market Price" are algorithmic estimates generated by AI context-matching and historical simulation logic. Because market trends are highly volatile, actual live prices on platforms like Amazon or Flipkart may differ. This tool is intended for educational research into AI-driven data analysis.
